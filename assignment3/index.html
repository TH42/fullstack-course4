        <h2 class="text-center">Chicken</h2>
        <p>Everything tastes like chicken, but chicken does not taste like everything. Sheldon Cooper can tell you all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken. Well, to be honest, Sheldon will tell you a lot of things, the least of which will interest you. He will tell you nevertheless. Because, you know, he thinks they are interesting.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Beef</h2>
        <p>Beef is a delicious meat to eat, unless, of course, you're Hindu. I won't argue with you about religious beliefs. But maybe, if you're not that religious, Sheldon Cooper has a solution for you. He can tell you all about frying meat that isn't chicken as if it were chicken. Well, to be honest, Sheldon will tell you a lot of things, the least of which will interest you. He will tell you nevertheless. Because, you know, he thinks they are interesting.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Sushi</h2>
        <p>I like sushi. It also tends to remind me of that Monty Python song 'I like Chinese', although sushi is from Japan and not from China. I guess Sheldon Cooper could tell you why that is. But I'm curious if he also knows how to fry fish as if it were chicken. Well, that's an interesting one, isn't it? Maybe I should propose this to the writers of 'The Big Bang Theory' to include in a future episode.</p>
